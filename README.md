# Douh
**Author:** Ekim Karabey
## Foreword
Douh was created as a side project so I could get more comfortable with backend web development, and because I needed a place to store my recipes!
If you would like to use my project online: [Click here to check out my website!](http://douh.herokuapp.com/)
## Quick-Start Guide
Once you make an account on douh, you will be able to add **recipes** and **ingredients** to your account. Ingredients are accessed from *My Ingredients* and recipes are accessed from *My Recipes*.
### Ingredients
The first thing you should create should be an **ingredient**. **Ingredients** are entered in a format such as this:

 > I buy [quantity] [unit] of [name] for [price]

As you can imagine, Ingredients are the building blocks of recipes.

### Recipes
Once you have a few ingredients, you can go on to create your first recipe. A recipe contains:
* A name
* Time needed and a quick description that is shown when browsing through a list of recipes
* Number of people fed
* A list of ingredients *(at least one ingredient required)*
* A paragraph on preperation instructions
* A paragraph on cooking instructions *(not mandatory, all recipes need to be prepared but not cooked)*
* A cost **calculated from adding up the ingredients**

Once the form is submitted, the recipe is posted on *Home*, as well as your *My Recipes*. When browsing on *Home* clicking on the username above someone else's will take you to that person's *My Recipes*.

**On the home page** recipes will be displayed in a short summary, showing the name, the author, the cost per person, the time to make, and the quick description.

**To go into a more detailed view** you can click on any recipe title on the home page, which will show the whole content of the recipe, with added formatting.
